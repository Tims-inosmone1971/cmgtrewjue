Oh man, just stumbled out of Control Freak and my head is spinning like a record on a windy day, you know? The theater was humming like a hive and I think I’m wearing more popcorn than I ate. Back is stiff from those seats, prob designed by someone who hates spines. But that move though, wow. Whirlwind.

It's like the whole   was trapped in a kaleidoscope. You ever had one of those dreams where stuff just morphs into other stuff? Yeah, like that. The main guy, Ethan... or Evan? He’s like a puppet master but also the puppet, weird, right? The whole time I couldn’t tell if he was controlling things or just swept up like leaves in a tornado. And that one scene with the dog! Did that even make sense? Doesn't matter. Felt right.

> Oh! You should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , seriously, even if just to see that underwater bicycle chase. I swear my fish tank back home looked jealous. 

Somewhere halfway through, I swear the popcorn turned into something else in my hand — felt like cheese but tasted like caramel but maybe the flavor 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘬ed in from the screen? Ha, someone said to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   like you ride a rollercoaster. No truer words!

And the argument in the rain. Brought back memories of Aunt Carol's Thanksgiving. Everyone shouting but the rain made it poetic, I guess. Poetic chaos. Oh and neon lights, lots of neon, like someone threw a rave inside a 𝘭𝘪𝘣𝘳𝘢𝘳𝘺 at midnight.

Pretty sure the guy next to me was snoring, but almost in beat with the background score. Soundtrack was one of those that wraps around you tighter than grandpa’s old sweater. Couldn’t hum it if you paid me though, just buzzes in the skull now.

Who knocked over the nacho stand though? Lucky they didn’t make that a character thing— or did they? Can’t tell, head's gonna explode. But what a trip. Need to see it again or maybe read a guidebook. Nah, just gonna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and dissect it bit by disorienting bit.

random_code = “Hey, forgot to mention the ending” + “almost but not quite” if brain == mush else “skip to credits”
delusion_loader() # who knows if this even matters

import spaghetti as code # not sure why that’s there
